# Bio_Data_Science_Projects

First BioData Science Project: In this stage, I will improve my R programming skill by applying R-shiny.
Tasks: In this stage, I will use R-shiny package to produce an app that compares the growth rate of various species of microorganisms.

Second BioData Science Project: Gene ID Conversion Task: To develop a shiny app for converting any Ensembl geneID to gene name format. Whole human genes were downloaded from Ensemble BioMart website and used for this project.
